# Argon Fan HAT Home-Assistant Addon

Specifically for this HAT: <https://argon40.com/en-gb/products/argon-fan-hat>

Home Assistant (HASS) Addon to fully support the Argon Fan HAT, for CPU temperature-based variable fan speed.

Important: Enable I2C first to make this work. This can be done in a couple of ways, either as described at <https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/os/#enable-i2c> or use the HassOS I2C Configurator from <https://github.com/adamoutler/HassOSConfigurator>.
